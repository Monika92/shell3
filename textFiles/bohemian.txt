Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide (no escape from reality)
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, (poor boy) I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, I just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun... But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooooooh
Didn't mean to make you cry, if I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come, sent shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go. Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
Mama, ooooooh. (Way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.


I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche , Scaramouche will you do the fandango?
Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening , me
Galileo, (Galileo), Galileo, (Galileo), Galileo, figaro
Magnifico-o-o-o-o-o
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah, no! We will not let you go.
Let him go!
Bismillah, no! We will not let you go.
Let me go!
Will not let you go.
Never never never let you go-o-o-o-o
No no no no no no no!
Oh mama Mia mama Mia
Mama Mia let me go
Beezlebub has a devil aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you can love me then leave me to die?
Oh, baby. Can't do this to me baby? Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here.

Oooooh. Oh yeah Oh yeah

Nothing really matters.
Anyone can see.
Nothing really matters...... Nothing really matters....
To me.
(Any way the wind blows)
